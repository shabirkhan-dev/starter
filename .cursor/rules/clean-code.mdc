# Clean Code

- **Names**: Clear, consistent. Components PascalCase; files match component name. Hooks `use*`; utils plain functions.
- **Size**: Prefer small functions and components. Extract when a file or function grows past a single concern.
- **Imports**: Prefer `@starter/*` for workspace packages. Group: external → workspace → relative. No unused imports.
- **Types**: Prefer explicit types for props and public APIs. Avoid `any`; use `unknown` and narrow when needed.
- **Errors**: Handle errors explicitly. Log and rethrow or return result types; avoid silent catches.
- **Format**: Use Biome. Run `bun run format` or rely on pre-commit. Don’t commit lint/format fixes in the same commit as feature changes when avoidable.
